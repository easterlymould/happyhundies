# HappyHundiesFlaskApp

Description: This project is a dynamic web application submitted that I made for a university module and business competition. It is a film website that displays a database of recommended films which are 100 minutes or fewer, using Flask/Python, SQL, Html, CSS

It previously also had an admin area, where I could push information to the database and store usernames and passwords. I have removed this functionality after submitting it for uni, because I don't need or want to store user accounts with this current iteration. All the changes I need to make to the film list, I would rather do direct to the database. So this explains why there are some redundant functions in the applauncher.py.

I plan to implement a better and crucially *secure* admin area in a later iteration, but for now the website is completely open access with me in control of the database at the back end.
