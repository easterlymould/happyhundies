# HappyHundiesFlaskApp

Description: This project is a dynamic web application submitted that I made for a university module. It is a film website that displays a database of recommended films, and also enables the admin of the website (me), to submit and delete films from the database.

It previously required an admin area, where I could push information to the database and store usernames and passwords in databases. I have removed this functionality after submitting it for uni, because I don't need or want to store user accounts, with this current iteration. All the changes I need to make to the film list, I would rather do direct to the database. So this explains why there are some redundant functions in the applauncher.py.
